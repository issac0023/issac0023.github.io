  <h3>Title: Interacting a Machine</h3>

  I made a machine that can interact but changed the background color from being warm to something at night. The machine'sbody color fits well with the background color to be a bit more intimidating. Even when it gets "big".

 I made another machine but I removed to body to make it more like its just standing there. With no body, it wouldn't be much of a threat. It just looks like a piece of art on display.
