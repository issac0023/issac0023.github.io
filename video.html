<p>For this project, it's a bit strange. I wanted to show what I like to do in my private time, so my brother shows what happens whenever I happen to hear voices or starnge sounds, even at a dark time in the fall. So I made a video with different soundtracks to make perfect time when a new scene starts. I also used transitions with texts at the beginning, also the end.
